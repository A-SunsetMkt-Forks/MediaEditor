| Ubuntu 20.04 | <a href="https://github.com/opencodewin/MediaEditor/releases/download/v0.9.8/MEC_SDL2_OpenGL3-ubuntu2004-x86_64-0.9.8.AppImage"><img src="docs/assets/download.svg"></a> |
| Ubuntu 22.04 | <a href="https://github.com/opencodewin/MediaEditor/releases/download/v0.9.8/MEC_SDL2_OpenGL3-ubuntu2204-x86_64-0.9.8.AppImage"><img src="docs/assets/download.svg"></a> |
| MacOS x86 | <a href="https://github.com/opencodewin/MediaEditor/releases/download/v0.9.8/MEC_SDL2_OpenGL3-MacOS-x86_64-0.9.8.dmg"><img src="docs/assets/download.svg"></a> |
| MacOS ARM | <a href="https://github.com/opencodewin/MediaEditor/releases/download/v0.9.8/MEC_SDL2_OpenGL3-MacOS-arm64-0.9.8.dmg"><img src="docs/assets/download.svg"></a> |

In addition, we also provide tutorials for compiling and installing our software from source code, Please go to [here](docs/dev/How-to-Built.md) üêß.

Until then, there are three things to note.

- ‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è Vulkan sdk is necessary, please [download](https://vulkan.lunarg.com/sdk/home) and install it.
- ‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è For linux, please make the AppImage file executable by the following command:
  ``` sh
  chmod +x MEC_SDL2_OpenGL3-linux-x86_64-x.x.x.AppImage
  ``` 
- ‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è And if you're using linux distros that use fuse3, and miss libfuse.so.2 to run the AppImage file, you can install it by:
  ``` sh
  sudo apt install libfuse2
  ```
