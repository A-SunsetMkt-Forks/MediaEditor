## GETTING STARTED
MEC's developers work hard to make it support a large range of devices and operating systems. We provide final as well as development builds. To get started, head over to the **[downloads section](https://github.com/opencodewin/MediaEditor/releases)** and simply select the platform that you want to install it on. A **[quick guide](docs/addit/Quick-Start.md)** to help you get acquainted with MEC is available in our docs.

## DEPENDENCIES
Although installers are much easier to use, if you must build from 
source, here are some tips: 

MEC needs some relevant submodules to be compiled to run. So, 
be sure you have the following submodules in order to run MEC successfully: 

*  imgui (https://github.com/opencodewin/imgui.git)
*  blueprintsdk (https://github.com/opencodewin/blueprintsdk.git)
*  mediacore (https://github.com/opencodewin/MediaCore.git)

## BUILDING
MEC uses CMake as its building system but instructions are highly dependent on your operating system and target platform. **[Building from source](docs/addit/How-to-Built.md)**.

## HOW TO CONTRIBUTE
MEC is created by users for users and **we welcome every contribution**. There are no highly paid developers or poorly paid support personnel on the phones ready to take your call. There are only users who have seen a problem and done their best to fix it. This means MEC will always need the contributions of users like you.

## LICENSE
MEC is **[GPLv3 licensed](LICENSE)**. You may use, distribute and copy it under the license terms.
