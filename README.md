## GETTING STARTED
MEC support as many operating systems as possible and provide release packages for those platforms. To get started, head over to the **[releases pageüí†](https://github.com/opencodewin/MediaEditor/releases)** and select the platform that you want to install it on. A **[quick guideüìù](docs/dev/Quick-Start.md)** to help you get acquainted with MEC is available in our docs.

There are two things to note:

- ‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è Vulkan sdk is necessary, please download and install it [here](https://vulkan.lunarg.com/sdk/home).
- ‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è For linux, please make the AppImage file executable by the following command:
``` sh
chmod +x MEC_SDL2_OpenGL3-linux-x86_64-x.x.x.AppImage
``` 
And if you're using linux distros that use fuse3, and miss libfuse.so.2 to run the AppImage file, you can install it by:
``` sh
sudo apt install libfuse2
```

## DEPENDENCIES
Although installers are much easier to use, if you must build from 
source, here are some tips: 

MEC needs some relevant submodules to be compiled to run. So, 
be sure you have the following submodules in order to run MEC successfully: 

*  imgui (https://github.com/opencodewin/imgui.git)
*  blueprintsdk (https://github.com/opencodewin/blueprintsdk.git)
*  mediacore (https://github.com/opencodewin/MediaCore.git)

## HOW TO BUILD
MEC uses CMake as its building system but instructions are highly dependent on your operating system and target platform. **[Building from sourceüêô](docs/dev/How-to-Built.md)**.

## HOW TO CONTRIBUTE
MEC is created by users for users and **we welcome every contribution**. There are no highly paid developers or poorly paid support personnel on the phones ready to take your call. There are only users who have seen a problem and done their best to fix it. This means MEC will always need the contributions of users like you.

## LICENSE
MEC is **[LGPLv3 licensed](LICENSE)**. You may use, distribute and copy it under the license terms.
